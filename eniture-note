These are the instructions for rewriting new extensions and use of this function.

Dummy keywords used:

           -> appName
           -> appNAME

=> appName:

        This keyword is used for rewriting 'ids' and also most of the js functions. This is keyword is used in the following files.

        -> common (js file).
        -> dropShip (js file)
        -> RAD (js file)
        -> Test connection (js file)
        -> Warehouse (js file)
        -> style (css file)
        -> All PHTML files.

        This keyword is also used in system.xml for just changing ID's of XML tags. Also I've changed the names for
        licnskey to LicenseKey this change is in system.xml and LTLOriginAddress.php.


=> appNAME:

        This keyword is used for few of js functions in js file which is mentioned in the above list.
